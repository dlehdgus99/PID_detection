# DeBERTa Model for PID Detection

This Jupyter Notebook details the process of training a DeBERTa model specifically designed for detecting Personal Identifiable Information (PID) within text. Below is an overview of the workflow and key sections of the notebook.

## Sections Overview

### 📝 Config & Imports
- **Configuration**: The model is configured with a maximum sequence length of 1024. Adjust as necessary based on your data requirements.

### 🗺️ Data Selection and Label Mapping
- **Data Selection**: This model utilizes a specialized dataset, including the "moth dataset", tailored for PID detection tasks.
- **Label Mapping**: Describes how various types of PID are identified and categorized.

### ♟️ Data Tokenization
- **Tokenization**: A unique tokenizer setup for DeBERTa that supports the specific requirements of PID detection tasks.

### 🏋🏻‍♀️ Training
- **Model Training**: The training section outlines a comprehensive approach using all available data to maximize model performance without an evaluation set.
- **Parameter Tuning**: Parameters are initially based on intuitive choices with a plan for iterative refinement.

### 💾 Save Models
- **Model Saving**: Detailed instructions on saving the trained model for deployment. Utilizes Jupyter Notebook's version control features.

## How to Use This Notebook
1. **Environment Setup**: Install DeBERTa and other required libraries.
2. **Prepare Your Dataset**: Configure data paths and ensure your data is formatted appropriately for PID detection.
3. **Execute the Notebook**: Follow the steps sequentially to train your model on detecting PID.
4. **Model Deployment**: Save your trained model and integrate it into your systems for real-time PID detection.

## Additional Notes
- The notebook is designed as a baseline. Adapt the settings and training parameters to enhance detection accuracy based on your specific data and needs.
